# portfolio-website

This is my best and favorite project so far. I built my personal website COMPLETELY from scratch.

I built a simple wireframe with HTML and Bootstrap. Then I styled it and gave it alot of cool interactive transitions
using CSS webkit-animations and jQuery to catch how the user is scrolling through the page. 

I hooked up the contact form using nodemailer.
